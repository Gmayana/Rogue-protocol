# Rogue-protocol 1.0

This is a texted based game about hacking, I have been working on it for a while, and v1.0 is still not completly done; But I am very close and I think I know how the gameplay will run.

So far they're aren't that many play testers and I am gonna give credit.

this is a passion project of mine that I intend to continue building. And hopefully I can release it soon but I don't want to get anyone hopes up.
