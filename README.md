# Rogue-protocol 1.0

This is a texted based game about hacking, I have been working on it for a while, and I just finished v1.0 and there will be updated and patches. For the future for any of you who want to download this as a zip for your personal enjoyment and possible editing of the code the exe is in the folder bin/debug/.net7 and then you should see the exe and possibley some other files.

So far they're aren't that many play testers and I am gonna give credit if anyone feels that it is needed.

this is a passion project of mine that I intend to continue building. And hopefully I can release on steam once I have v1.1 done as there will be better gameplay with that update. To read more about it go to the last paragrph.

in the version 1.1 there will be new gameplay features like a campain, and maybe more. And there will also be a folder for an apple version of the game that will be replaced every update. There will maybe be some visual changes but don't expect it. Anyway if you are reading thank you.
